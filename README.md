## Git and GitHub
Not quite clear at first, it became clear later. Absolutely like [gitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).
Almost all the commands were new to me, Git is logical, understandable, surprisingly interesting. Can't wait using branches and resolving merge conflicts!

## Linux CLI, and HTTP
I was impressed to discover the command line capabilities. Command line is cool! Who needs UI?

[x] Read the article "HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know"
[ ] Good understanding of http:
Absolutely need more info about The Protocol every developer must know.

## Git Collaboration
What's new:
- multiple remote directories
- difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`
- contributing via forking repos
- `git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all`

To contribute
- read CONTRIBUTING.md file
- use topic branch
- make frequent, smaller commits
- be clear and polite

Here are my screenshots:

Definitely going to make a lot of pull requests, hope to contribute in future))

## Intro to HTML and CSS 
What was new to me:
- fallback fonts
- adding local fonts to a document with the `@font-face` property
- `margin: 0 auto`
- vertical margins collapse
- HSL colors
- relative sizing unit â€” `fr`
- CSS transitions
- how `clear` property works

What surprised me - how much I liked it, not just learning new rulesets, but writing my own lines of code.

Interested in more practice with:
- CSS selectors
- `position` and `display` properties
- grids
- elegant flexboxes

## Responsive Web Design 
What became a useful discovery to me:
- media queries, breakpoints
- common responsive patterns: column drop, mostly fluid, layout shifter, off canvas
- responsive tables techniques
- the browser reports the width in DIPs (remember about a device pixel ratio)
- good to use: relative units, font-boosting, common sense

What surprised me? There is another big topic to learn - responsive images!
What do I intend to use in future? Any technique or tip that will help me to do the layout responsive and the site more user-friendly!

## HTML & CSS practice: Hooli-style Popup
It was great!! I missed some instructions and spent a lot of time trying to make the popup look exactly like on the picture. Good lesson for me to be more attentive. 
I learned how to make a little triangle so that popup looks like going from definite icon. I trained to use flexbox, made my first real commits, understood they must be more frequent. It was pleasure to write code, so as rewrite.

## JS Basics
Notes I leave here (and what was new):
* JS - loosely typed programming language
* data types: boolean, null, undefined, number, string, symbol and Object
* use camelCase for variables
* ternary operator
* functions, powerful and complicated, callback
* `const`, `let`, `var` variables, block and global scope
* destructuring assignment
* Functional programming: pure, isolated functions, avoid mutations and side effects, always declare dependencies and stay calm!
